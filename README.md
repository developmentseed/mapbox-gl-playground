# GL Design Playground

##Setup

In this directory, run `npm install`.

## Start

Run `npm start` and then open http://localhost:9966

## Experiments

Experiment with the JSON style and the map will update.  If you get something
you want to save/share, download the JSON and put it in the `experiments` folder.
You can view experiments that are in there by appending `#/experiment/NAME` to the URL,
e.g. http://localhost:9966/#/experiment/vba-1 to see `vba-1.json` in action.
